# LandscapeFold

Contains code implementing the LandscapeFold algorithm, described in Kimchi et al. "A Polymer Physics Framework for the Entropy of Arbitrary Pseudoknots" (2019). All code for that paper was implemented in MATLAB and all results and figures from that paper can be recreated using the code in the /MATLAB folder. 

The code has since been translated to Python, and new features are expected to be added to the Python framework. Instructions on how to run the code in Python are available as comments within the code and in a forthcoming book chapter (RNA structure prediction, Methods in Mol. Biol. Springer.)
