# LandscapeFold

Contains code implementing the LandscapeFold algorithm, described in Kimchi et al. "A Polymer Physics Framework for the Entropy of Arbitrary Pseudoknots" (2019). All code for that paper was implemented in MatLab. The code has since been translated to Python, and new features are expected to be added to the Python framework.
